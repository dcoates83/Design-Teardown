In this simple project, I’ll be breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine with which you’re probably familiar by now – Smashing Magazine. The goal for this exercise is to start training myself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

My job is to create a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy.
